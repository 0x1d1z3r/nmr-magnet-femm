# nmr-magnet-femm
Software to calculate magnetic field homogeneity in DIY NMR magnets

Inspired by "Shim-free homebuilt 2 T magnet for NMR spectroscopy with sub-ppm resolution and sub-nanomole sensitivity"

https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-3303984/v1

## Requirements:
MATLAB (tested on R2024b) / Octave (not yet tested)

FEMM: https://www.femm.info/wiki/Download
## Setup / Usage
- Change the path in magnet.m so it points to your FEMM mfiles
- change the parameters to your specifications
- run in MATLAB & wait for the results
